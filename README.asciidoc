=== Home Assistant - custom components 

Used for defining Tasmota sensors/switch/binary sensors 

==== Sync to version 

1. Home Assistant: *0.103.3* 
2. AppDaemon: *3.0.3* 

==== How to install custom components into your setup 

Copy this project `<config directory>/custom_components/` folder to your `<config directory>` directory 
make sure you are in sync with the the right version of hass (see above)

==== tasmota_counter (for Pulse counter/Water)

Using this, you could define a sensor that saves Tasmota counter_id pulses info to none-volatile home assistance database. 
See discussion here link:https://github.com/arendst/Sonoff-Tasmota/issues/4681[4681]

[source,bash]
-------------------
  - platform: tasmota
    name: water_total
    stopic: water_out    
    id: 1        
    max_valid_diff: 2000 
    unit_of_measurement: 'l' 
    icon: mdi:water-pump
    expire_after: 300 
    value_template: "{{ (45497 + (value))|int }}"
-------------------


*stopic*: the short topic. for example the full topic will be `tele/*stopic*/SENSOR` 

*counter_id*: the id of the counter 1..4

*max_valid_diff*:  maximum difference in 60 sec 


==== mqtt_tasmota (Switch)

Define a switch in a simpler way. It just works

* Always in sync with hass
* No need Option59,
* No need startup script command
* No need to define LWT/Qos. Qos is 1

See discussion here link:https://github.com/home-assistant/home-assistant/issues/18703[18703]

[source,yaml]
-------------------
  switch:
    - platform: tasmota
      name: HASS_DEVICE
      index: '1' 
      stopic: SHORT_TOPIC
-------------------

*stopic*: the short topic. for example the full topic will be `tele/*stopic*/SENSOR` e.g. `tele/irrigation/SENSOR`

*name*: e.g. wbi_p1 the switch.wbi_p1 the full name

==== tasmota_alarm MCP230xx

Define 16/8 binary sensors based on MCP230xx chipset in a simple way. 
This chip has two mqtt async responses(interrupt and status) and it is tedious to define all of them.


[source,yaml]
-------------------
 tasmota:
   devices:
    - name: HASS_NAME
      stopic: TOPIC
      binary_sensors:
         - name: door
           polar: true
         - name: vol
           polar: true
         - name: kitchen
           polar: true
         - name: backdoor
           polar: true
-------------------

==== accumulator

Aggregate /accumulate using events the time something is working (e.g. time TV is on)  per day/week/month. No need to query the database which is a *slow* operation 

[source,yaml]
-------------------
 sensor:
   - platform: accumulator
     name: boiler_total_hours2
     entity_id: switch.b0
     state_on: 'on'
     state_off: 'off'
-------------------


==== tp_link various versions routers trackers

Support older firmware versions (my home versions) of devices and support more than 8 connected clients to each devices (bug in hass). 
Have a way to disable the C7 as there is only one that can be connected 


==== dnsmasq tracker 

Using script to trigger tracker from link:https://jpmens.net/2013/10/21/tracking-dhcp-leases-with-dnsmasq/[tracking-dhcp] 
use custom component to let hass known link:custom_components/device_tracker/mqtt_dnsmasq.py[mqtt_dnsmasq.py]
to get the info from link:linux_services/dnsmasq.sh[dnsmasq.sh]


==== Irrigation based on Weather actual data 

The objective is to irrigate base on actual weather data (no forcast). 
A simple model of leaky bucket from networking (policer) is used. 

1. Rain will fill the bucket (up to maximum)
2. Evaporation reduce the bucket - there are many models for ev 

The simplet Blaney-Criddle is used here (base on mean temperature and p - hours of daylight )

see link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blaney%E2%80%93Criddle_equation[BlaneyCriddle]

3. Irrigation time is based on the bucket level at the time of irrigation time. 

Irrigation time = (-bucket level) * max_tap_time (min)

After Irrigation the bucket is zeroed
WBI works the same as your old system it just reduce the time when it it fits (e.g. rain, cold days etc) 

*Example*: 


.Without wbi
[options="header",cols="1,1,1,1,1,6"]
|=======================================
| Day  | old value |evaporation (-) | rain Ev (+) | new value      | desc
|0     | 0   | -200 | +500 | +300|  rain of ~5mm total
|1     | +300| -200| 0 | +100|no rain , no irrigation 
|2     | +100|-200| 0 | -100   | can irrigate
|3     | -100|-200| 0 | -300   | can irrigate 
|4*    | -300|-100| 0 | 0   | can irrigate -- scheduled calculate the time
|=======================================

.Without wbi
[options="header",cols="1,1,1,1,1,6"]
|=======================================
| Day  | old value |evaporation (-) | rain Ev (+) | new value      | desc
|0     | 0   | -300 | 0 | -300|  rain of ~5mm total
|1     | -300| -300| 0 | -600|no rain , no irrigation 
|2     | -600|-300| 0 | -900   | can irrigate
|3     | -900|-300| 0 | -1200   | can irrigate 
|4*    | -1200|-300| 0 | 0   | can irrigate -- scheduled calculate the time
|=======================================


As you can see this simple model can tune the irrigation time dynamically base on the weather actual data (again, no forcast needed)
The feedback/calculation is slow and done per day 

.Sample of compoenent 
[source,yaml]
-------------------

wb_irrigation:
  api_key: !secret openweathermap_key
  rain_factor: 120
  max_ev: 3750 
  min_ev: -1500.0
  name: "wb_irrigation"
  longitude: !secret accurate_longitude
  latitude: !secret accurate_latitude
  taps: 
    - name: p1
    - name: p2
-------------------

1. api_key: a free key to  link:https://openweathermap.org/[openweathermap.org]
2. rain_factor: ev/mm factor 
3. max_ev: the maximum of the bucket level. if a rainy day has an evaporation of ~150 ev. 3750 means that after a good rain we can stop irrigation for ~20 days
4. min_ev: the minimum of the bucket level. it is not possible to compensate for more than this ev
5. longitude,latitude for accurate value for irrigation 
6. taps names. each will have a sensor with bucket calculation 

It will define a few sensors with prefix of name_xx for rain/ev/bucket for each tap
With the above example there would be *wb_irrigation_p1* and *wb_irrigation_p2* sensors one for each tap.

For the switch relay (turn on/off the water taps) Sonoff 4ch pro is used. In this example the two first channels are used 

.Tasmota configuration (once)

=== Appdaemon apps 


==== HeatApp app

TelePeriod 60
SetOption36 20
-------------------

* Rule1 The first rule make sure that if sonoff (TH16) disconnect from controler (wifi/broker is down/hass is down) the power won't stay on for more than 2 hours
* poweronstate 0 : if sonoff reset set power to off (rules won't help here, beacuse rules trigger by change and not at boot)
* SetOption36 20 : to disable boot loop 
* TelePeriod 60  : set notification each 1 min


==== CWaterMonitor app

see link:https://github.com/hhaim/hass/wiki/Monitor-water-consumption-and-more-with-Home-Assistant[wiki] for a full example

==== SimpleTimerOff

==== OutdoorLampWithPir app

Turn on light based by PIR sensor 


==== Weather base irrigation

see link:https://github.com/hhaim/hass/wiki/Weather-based-irrigation[wiki] for a full example 

The app is responsible to to turn on the taps in specific schedule. +
The total time is calculated from the weather component (*wb_irrigation* see below). +
In case the tap state is changed to ON (manually) the time is taken from the input and weather queue is not updated.+ 
It is possible to estimate how much littler is consumed by each tap using the global water input sensor (if exists)  

See here for switch and sensor defenition for this app to work link:pkgs/irrigation.yaml[pkgs/irrigation.yaml].+
The app is located here link:apps/heat_app.py[CWBIrrigation].+
